## Hacker News Basic Statistics

Orignally started as updating the stats that were available on Ryan Williams' Hiring Trends, as it turned
out the github is out of date so ended up needing to add functionality. Will admit that I'm a negative
fan of Ruby and it was fast enough to rewrite into Python to add functionality.

Ultimatly would like to do a lot more with this.

## ToDo - would like to pull in some features from

http://hnhiring.me/ -- Basic posting search engine

http://www.gosmartsolutions.com/hn/?id=11814828 -- Breaking out keywords by area

* Langauge (Python, Ruby, ...)
* Database (MySQL, Cassandra, Elastic, etc.)
* Framework (Angular, React, ...)
* Location (onsite, full-time, remote, intern, visa, part-time, freelance)

Would then like to start looking at locations and then looking into company history, posting history
document similarity... On and on...
